# Simple Neural Style Transfer Web Application

## Overview

This project is a **Simple Neural Style Transfer Web Application** built using Flask and TensorFlow Hub. The application allows users to upload a content image, choose a style image, and apply neural style transfer to generate an artistic, stylized version of the content image. The result can be previewed on the webpage and downloaded for personal use.

## Features

- Upload your own content image.
- Choose from multiple predefined style images.
- Apply Neural Style Transfer using a TensorFlow Hub model.
- Preview the stylized output directly on the web page.
- Download the output image for personal use.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Backend framework to handle file uploads and manage the web server.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend for designing the user interface.
- **Bootstrap**: Responsive styling and layout for the web page.
- **TensorFlow Hub**: Pre-trained neural style transfer model.
- **Neural Style Transfer**: Deep learning technique for combining a content image with a style image to produce a stylized output.

## Neural Style Transfer

Neural Style Transfer is a deep learning technique that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to apply the artistic style of one image to the content of another image. This involves the following steps:

1. **Content Image**: The image you want to stylize (e.g., a landscape, portrait).
2. **Style Image**: The artistic style you want to apply (e.g., Van Gogh's painting, a texture).
3. **Output Image**: The result of blending the content and style images.

The algorithm utilizes **convolutional layers** from a pre-trained model (such as VGG19) to separate and recombine the **content** and **style** from the respective images. The goal is to minimize the content loss (difference from the original content image) and style loss (difference from the style imageâ€™s artistic texture) using optimization techniques.

## TensorFlow Hub Model

TensorFlow Hub provides access to a variety of pre-trained models, including the neural style transfer model used in this project. This makes it easy to integrate advanced deep learning functionalities without having to train a model from scratch.

The specific TensorFlow Hub model used for this project is a pre-trained neural style transfer model that allows us to transform content images by applying different artistic styles with minimal setup.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Content Image**: The user uploads an image they want to stylize.
2. **Select a Style Image**: Choose one of the predefined style images to apply.
3. **Apply Style Transfer**: The backend processes the images using the TensorFlow Hub model, combining the content and style.
4. **Preview & Download**: The stylized image is displayed, and the user can download the result.
